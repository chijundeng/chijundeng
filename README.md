### 🎓 About Me
Hi there! I’m <em>Chijun</em>, a PhD student at Fudan University focusing on **brain imaging** and **computational neuroscience**, especially **autism spectrum disorder (ASD)**. My research aims to uncover the dynamic architecture of the brain across the human lifespan and to understand the neural mechanisms underlying ASD.
